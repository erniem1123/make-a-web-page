		<div class="description"><p> In this section I will describe how HTML can be viewed as an operational tree to create the boxes of your webpage. </p>
		<p> In this section we discussed HTML, CSS and DOM. <b>HTML</b> (as we stated during the Basic Structure page) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. <b>CSS</b> stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in markup language. <b>DOM</b> stands for Document Object Model and is a cross platform language independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and other markup languages). The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree.</p>
		<p>We went through several exercises by opening our example web page and looking through the options and functions of the developer tools in Chrome. We explored the objects and determined that all objects in the Web are in boxes though their appearance can be altered in the using CSS. We had a working example of how front end developers take the example of what is wanted as an HTML and define the boxes organize the data and begin building the website. We also looked at the process of examining code and understanding what the final outcome will look like based on the layout of the code.</p>
