		<div class="description"><p>In this secion of my notes I will descibe some of the main tags and their uses. Tags are the code known as <b>Markup</b> that allows you to modify the content of your web page. There are dozens of tags that were not covered but the specific tags covered were as follows:</p>
			<p><b>TAGS</b></p>
			<p><b>BOLD</b> - Bold is the code written in order to make the desired text in your HTML bold for emphasis. The Bold tag is written"< b >" and is closed by writing "< /b >". Bold is also an <em>"inline"</em> element. (which is to say that it does not create a box around the desired text.)</p>
			<p><b><em>EMPHASIS</em></b> - Emphasis is the code written in order to make the desired text in your HTML document italicized. This tag is written as "< em >" and is closed by writing "< /em >". Emphasis is also an <em>"inline"</em> element.
			<p>Next we went through a number of "attributes". Attributes differ from tags as style elements can be added to attributes to modify their look. There are many more than are listed below.</p>
			<p><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></p>
			<p><b>Anchor</b> - Anchor is used to add hyperlinks into your documnents. Anchor is writen as "< a href="url" > contents < / a>". Anchor is an <em>"inline"</em> element.</p>
			<p><b>Image</b> - Image is used to add pictures into your documnents. Image is writen as "< img src="url" alt="text" >" and there is no closing statement. Image is an <em>"inline"</em> element.</p>
			<p><b>Whitespace</b> - White space in your code does not provide changes to the look of your website. Whitespace is defined as White space is the empty spaces in a design. White space is used to separate disparate design elements and group similar ones. White space is the lack of graphics or text in the layout.</p>
			<p><b>Break</b> - Break is used to drop future text down one line into your documnents. Break is writen as "< br >" and there is not closing statement. Break is an <em>"inline"</em> element.</p>
			<p><b>Paragraph</b> - Paragraph is used to drop future text down one line into your documnents. Paragraph is writen as "< p >" and the closing statement is "< /p >". Paragraph is a <em>"block"</em> element. (which is to say that a box <b>is</b> created around the text.)</p>
			<p><b>Span/Div</b> - Span and Div simialrly to Paragraph and Break in your documnents. Span is written "< span class="foo" >" and closed with "< /span >". Div is written "< div class="bar" >" and closed with "< /div >". The term class is used to add styles to your statements. Span is an <em>"inline"</em> element and Div is a <em>block</em> element. </p>
			<p><b>HTML Document Format</b> - is the overall coding structure that needs to be followed to insure the document can be viewed correctly.</p>
			<p><br>
			<b>ROW #1 < !DOCTYPE html ></b> - in this course we will be working with DOCTYPE html (html5).<br>
			<b>ROW #2 < html ></b><br>
			<b>ROW #3 < head ></b><br>
			<b>ROW #4 < title >CONTENT< /title ></b><br>
			<b>ROW #5 < /head ></b><br>
			<b>ROW #6 < body ></b><br>
			<b>ROW #7 < b > CONTENT < /b ></b><br>
			<b>ROW #8 < /body ></b><br>
			<b>ROW #9 < /html ></b></p>
			<p>In this course we will be applying our main focus on the "body" section of HTML.</p>
