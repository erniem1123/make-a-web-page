		<div class="description"><p>This is my first submission for the <a href="http://www.udacity.com">Udacity's</a> Introduction to Programming Class. I have broken down my notes into the following catagories. <b> 1) Basic Structure, 2) Tags and Attributes, 3) Operational Tree Structure, and 4) CSS and Style</b>. As my training continues more catagories will be added to round out my overall knowledge and understanding of the subject matter. Should any restructuring need to take place</p>
		<p>I will continue to create additional pages that can be found on the left hand side of the page below my picture that will represent logical sections of the course based on the view of the course that I have at the time. Occasionally notes will be added to the home page to express opinions and commentary about the overall class itself.</p>
		<p> My first oberservation is, there may be too many options offered in tools to use in creating your website. It was quite difficult to pick one that would work. The overall content is amazing. I can't believe I am off and running in such a short period of instruction. That deserves two thumbs up!</p></div>
