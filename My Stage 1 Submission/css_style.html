		<div class="description"><p> In this section I will explain how CSS styling will assist in preventing repetitive code and enhance the overall look of youe webpage. We examined the process of defining our object with classes and creating CSS definitions that will change the style and "look" of the objects in your webpage. From borders to margins, font size to font type. The overall look of your elements can be controlled through CSS without having to repeat those changes over and over again. It will also help you manage your box placement within your webpage. Cool Stuff!</p></div>
		<p>We also discussed the overall process to follow as we move forward in our web design.</p>
		<p>1) Look for "natural" boxes.</p>
		<p>2) Look for repeated styles and semantic elements.</p>
		<p>Steps 3 and 4 are iterative ansd will be repeated throughout the process.</p>
		<p>3) Write your HTML.</p>
		<p>4) Apply styles from biggest to smallest.</p>
		<p>5) Fix things.</p>
